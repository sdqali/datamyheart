This is the `slides` for the talk @craftybones and I did at the recently concluded XConf at ThoughtWorks Bangalore. This contains both our presentation and the visualizations we showed off.

To see the visualizations in action, run:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:8000/presentation/index.html` and take it from there.
